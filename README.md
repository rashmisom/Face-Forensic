FaceForensics++: Learning to Detect Manipulated Facial Images
The rapid progress in synthetic image generation and manipulation has now come to a  point where it raises significant concerns on the implication on the society. At best, this  leads to a loss of trust in digital content, but it might even cause further harm by  spreading false information and the creation of fake news. 

In this case study, we will build a machine learning model that learns to detect  manipulated facial images.  We have access to a dataset of fake and real videos. We have to train a model to predict  whether the given video(or image sequence) is fake or real.
